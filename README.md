# Discord Encrypter
A chrome extension that modifies Discord to have an encrypted chat function. As this is currently a work in progress, the settings page does not work. You have to hardcode the token and encryption key into the code yourself.


Coming soon:
- Working settings page
- Support for channels that are not direct messages
- Support for multiple channels
- Support for multiple encryption keys at once
- Fixing issue where the send button will dissapear randomly
- Add ability to hide the send button on certain channels
- Working decryption of incoming messages
